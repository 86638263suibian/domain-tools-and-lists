Useful number, letter and word lists for domain searching and testing of registrars. Added a ccTLD lists for prospectors and operators alike. I use these daily, thought it might be of some help to others in the domain space.

- 002 - Number Lists, NN, NNN and NNNN
- 003 - Word Lists, English 4 - 8 Characters
